Introduction
This report will be assessed for its accuracy and completeness across all aspects of the test. Its 
objective is to verify that the applicant has the technical expertise and comprehensive 
understanding of penetration testing methodologies required to meet the specified criteria.

1. Objective
The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal network penetration test on the 
specified Personal network. The task requires following a comprehensive and systematic approach 
to achieve the desired outcomes. This test aims to simulate a real-world penetration test within the 
provided testing environment. Additionally, it demonstrates the candidate’s approach from start to 
finish, including the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities, as well as the creation of a 
detailed report.

1. Requirements
The tester is required to complete a comprehensive penetration testing report, which should 
include the following sections:
• Executive Summary and Recommendations: A non-technical overview summarizing key 
findings and suggested actions.
• Methodology and Vulnerability Analysis: A detailed explanation of the testing approach and 
identified vulnerabilities.
• Findings with Evidence: Each finding should include screenshots, step-by-step walkthroughs, 
and sample code.
• Additional Observations: Any other relevant information not covered in the previous 
sections.

2. Project Scope
This section defines the scope and boundaries of the project.
Project Name: Metasploitable2
Description: Metasploitable2 is a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine (VM) 
designed for penetration testing training and security research. It is 
widely utilized by cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts 
to simulate real-world attack scenarios within a controlled environment.

Scope: 192.168.219.132
SUB: VAPT

  Vulnerability
  Service Enumeration via Open Ports

Vulnerability Description:
  Service enumeration is a method used to identify the services running on specific ports of a target 
  system and determine their versions. This version information is crucial because it allows attackers 
  to search for known security vulnerabilities associated with the identified software versions. 
  During service enumeration on Metasploitable2, we observed that the application has many open 
  ports, each revealing the service name and its version. An attacker can use this information to 
  search for available exploits on the internet or in hacking payload databases. These exploits can 
  then be used to compromise the system.
  Open Ports
  21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 111, 139, 445, 512, 513, 514, 1099, 1524, 2121, 3306, 3632, 5900, 6000, 
  6667, 6697, 8009, 36979, 40940, 51217, 51247

Technical Impact:
  Identification of Vulnerabilities: Attackers can map running services, detect outdated versions, and exploit 
  known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
  Unauthorized Access: Weak or misconfigured services (e.g., open SSH, FTP, or RDP) can be exploited to 
  gain unauthorized access.
  Privilege Escalation: Enumerated services may have misconfigured permissions or weak 
  authentication, allowing attackers to escalate privileges.
